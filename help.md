# Help Menu

Welcome to OpShell - an options scanner and tracker built to work within the Terminal (or Shell!). This help screen will introduce the main features of OpShell. 

## Trade Tracker

OpShell is designed to help retail traders track their option trades. It is targeted toward tracking naked or cash-secured puts.

1. Press `I` to enter a new trade. Here, you can put in information about the trade. *note: dates have to entered in the "DD Mmm YYYY" format (e.g. 21 Oct 2021)* 
2. This new trade will be updated in the "Trades" panel on the home screen. The breakeven price of the stock will be automatically calculated for you and the text color will change when the option is set to expire in 21 days. 
3. Press `E` to edit your trades (i.e. roll or close). 
4. Press `S` to manage your account. You can either update the deposit amount or choose to save your account to a pickle file which can then be loaded again the next time you open up OpShell
